        <h2>What is Halloween?</h2>
        <p>Halloween is a holiday celebrated in many countries on October 31st. It originated from the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, which was believed to be a time when the boundary between the living and the dead was thinnest. People would dress up in costumes and light bonfires to ward off evil spirits. Today, Halloween is celebrated with traditions like carving pumpkins, trick-or-treating, and attending themed parties. It is often associated with spooky and supernatural themes, including ghosts, witches, and monsters. </p>
